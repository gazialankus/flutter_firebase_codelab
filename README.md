We used these two codelabs;

-[Write Your First Flutter App, part 1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/)

-[Write Your First Flutter App, part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/)

Then, we made use of this other codelab to add Firebase to the app that we created above.
